## How to contribute

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching through Pull Requests.

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a PR with a _failing test case_.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug, or cleans up code?**

* Great! Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Great! Before you spend a lot of effort writing the new feature, you should first submit a PR with a code comment describing how you'd like the feature to work, including any function signatures, so we can discuss it further.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Please go to Stack Overflow for questions about code!

#### **Do you want to contribute to the documentation? Did you spot a typo in the documentation?**

* Great! Open up a PR fixing it!

Thanks! :heart: :heart: :heart:
